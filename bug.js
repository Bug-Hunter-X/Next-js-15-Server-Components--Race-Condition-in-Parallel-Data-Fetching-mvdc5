In Next.js 15, a particularly unusual error can arise when using server components with a complex data fetching setup involving multiple parallel requests. If these requests depend on each other or share mutable state, race conditions can easily appear.  For example, imagine fetching user data then their associated orders; if you attempt to use the user data before the order data has fully loaded, you might get an unexpected `undefined` or an incomplete order list, leading to application crashes or inconsistent behaviour.
